# Introduction
----
In this repo, there will be all kinds languages that I have written, like Python, JavScript, Java, C++, and more.

# Goal/Objective
---
Main goal is to be able to learn and remember all of the things I've written, without the help of AI tools (ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta, Grok, perplexity.ai etc) completely.

# Scope
---
As mentioend, I will not use any AI tools at all when coding. However, I can search for resources from forums and communities and tutorial websites such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, Quora, Khan Academy, GFG, W3S and many more.

I will also be sourcing some websites that I have visited and found it useful.
